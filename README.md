then Flash the Drive, this can take sometime, Then first boot will also take the longest. _Tea Refill._


# Once loaded the OS. SFTP, SSH and Python3 access should be Enabled, go in your router and you will see its IP address.  <br/>
- Install the below,  this takes about 10 minutes for the first time, then from there it takes about 5. <br/>
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-gpiozero
sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y
sudo apt install python-gpiozero-doc -y
```

# Soldering
From what I used two GPIO `17` & `27`, plust two Grounds. (See below): <br/>

# Triggering point.
Make sure you have `pip` Installed otherwise:   <br/>
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
In this same repo, I'm sharing the python file, where you need to make changes to your Internal and External host to ping acccoringly.  <br/>
`nano main.py` , `CTRL + X`  ,  to save the file  <br/>
Add the context, then run the file with this.  <br/>
```python3 main.py```  <br/>

# Et Voila! Final Produt.
