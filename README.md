# Goal of this: To create a device that will sense online Activitity from the Internet and Locally.
unconsciously maybe I was inspired by the ITCROWD. and their Internet box ü§£

# Flashing the Drive:
Download the RPI Manager: https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/ <br/>

Yes <br/>

then Flash the Drive, this can take sometime, Then first boot will also take the longest. _Tea Refill._


# Once loaded the OS. SFTP, SSH and Python3 access should be Enabled, go in your router and you will see its IP address.  <br/>
- Install the below,  this takes about 10 minutes for the first time, then from there it takes about 5. <br/>
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-gpiozero
sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y
sudo apt install python-gpiozero-doc -y
```

# Soldering
From what I used two GPIO `17` & `27`, plust two Grounds. (See below): <br/>

This is a sample Diagram on how this needs to be soldered: <br/>

# Triggering point.
Make sure you have `pip` Installed otherwise:   <br/>
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
In this same repo, I'm sharing the python file, where you need to make changes to your Internal and External host to ping acccoringly.  <br/>
`nano main.py` , `CTRL + X`  ,  to save the file  <br/>
Add the context, then run the file with this.  <br/>
```python3 main.py```  <br/>

# Et Voila! Final Produt. üòé

Now this saves me trips to the Router or Modem, and I have it powered by a small power bank since this is a such low voltage.

what else can I use it for, hmm: <br/>
- technically, People that do not how to read the LEDs on a switch + Modem
- Monitor my own site(s). (after all you have many combination of colors)
- it could be mobile too, as long as I can Add a VPN
- I can automate it so it starts as a service, and completely  Automated
- notification for new products if I was to add a scraper..... list can go on an on.
